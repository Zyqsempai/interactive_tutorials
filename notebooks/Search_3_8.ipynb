It might be helpful to think about linking fields in the same way you think about indexing attributes, although not exactly the same. When you link data to a view it is indexed in a way that allows for quick retrieval. This process also stores the data in a way that allows for the ArangoSearch-specific AQL functions to perform unique queries such as tokenizing, stemming, removing stop words, and as we will see in this notebook complex matching functions.\n",

One of the simplest ways of calculating similarity between two words is calculating the longest common sequence (LCS) of letters. The longer the LCS is the more similar the words are. However, this approach has one big disadvantage â€“ absence of context. For example, words `connection` and `fonetica` have a long LCS (o-n-e-t-i) but very different meanings.
